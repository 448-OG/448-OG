## Hi there, I am Charles! 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on open source libraries and tools in decentralized payments & end-to-end networks infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about and contributing to Decentralized Payment Networks.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Rust open source projects in payments and messaging infrastructure.
- 💬 Ask me about Rust Programming Language and Open Source.
- 📫 How to reach me: [superuser@448.africa](mailto:superuser@448.africa?subject=Collaboration&body=I%20saw%20your%20profile%20on%20Github%20and%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20collaborating%20on%20...) or [@448_og](https://x.com/448_OG/) on X(formerly Twitter)

## Open Source Projects

### Technical Writing
[448.africa](https://448.africa)

### Decentralized Payments and End-to-End Encrypted Networks
- 🏗️ [Solana Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/JamiiDao/SolanaWalletAdapter) - a pure Rust library for Solana ecosystem for connecting to wallets that implement the wallet standard.
- [Krill](https://github.com/JamiiDao/Krill/blob/master/docs/SPECSHEET.md) `(Under development)` - Institution grade server for Solana onchain licensed institution attestions, POAPs, tokenization, onchain memberships and Monetary Exchange using distributed signing with FROST signatures on untrusted servers.
- Distributed Passkey Key Management and Signing `(RESEARCH STAGE)` - passkey distributed key generation and Schnorr signining using modified WebAuthn/Passkey wallet with cross-platform sync and backup support

### Dev Experience tools
- [DirMeta](https://github.com/448-OG/DirMeta) - Extend std::fs with extra functionality like total directory size and returning all files and errors instead of returning an error
- [countries-iso3166](https://github.com/448-OG/Countries-ISO3166) - A `no_std` crate used to convert between UTF-8 Strings and country codes for easier handling of country names in ISO 3166 format.
- [MemUtils](https://github.com/448-OG/MemUtils) - Create random byte arrays, securely handle management of byte secrets in memory.
  

### Research
- [X3DH-448](https://github.com/448-OG/X3DH-448) - A modified version of Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman (X3DH) Key Agreement Library used in Signal Protocol. This swaps SHA256 for Blake3 as it is aimed a very low power hardware support even where SHA256 accelleration instructions are not available.
- [MEMSECURITY](https://github.com/448-OG/MEMSECURITY) - Securely hold secrets in memory and protect them against cross-protection-boundary readout via microarchitectural, via attacks on physical layout, and via coldboot attacks.
- [x402-Links](https://github.com/JamiiDao/x402-Links) - The x402-links is a specification for discovering and interacting with x402 resources in the real-world through deep-links and QR Codes. 
- [Blinded-Diffie-Hellman-Merkle-Algorithm](https://github.com/448-OG/Blinded-Diffie-Hellman-merkle) - A research implementation of the Blinded Diffie-Hellman Algorithm used in Ecash for financial inclusion of grassroot communities.
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/448-engineering/Puppeteer) - An experimental Rust cross-platform GUI using WRY toolkit
- [Token-Extensions](https://github.com/448-OG/Token-Extensions) - Solana token extensions using Rust without any frameworks like anchor
